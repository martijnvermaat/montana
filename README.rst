Montana
=======

Simple event monitor.

Services on remote systems send event notifications to the Montana server
using a REST protocol. The notification includes service name, status and
hostname.

The Montana web frontend shows recent events with their status.

This is basically a minimal working prototype which I will be working out
further if my agenda allows.
